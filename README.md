# Mini_4_DOM_Calculator

I set myself the task to create a calculator from scratch using the following tools:

- HTML
- CSS (with a little bit of Bootstrap)
- Plain Javascript.

On account of wanting to make it a better learning process for myself, I deliberately did not look at other implementations of how a calculator could be coded and instead focused on making my own solution. This has been my first attempt at coding something completely from scratch without following someone else's template.

The different stages for the calculations were worked out based on a homegrown Finite State Machine (FSM) model.

Features:

- Divide by zero error handling.
- Current result display.
- Last operation displayed.
- Automatic bracket insertion for negative numbers.
- A wee bit of homegrown basic precision adjustment on certain mathematical operations.

The outcome is not 100% perfect (e.g. it is not 100% responsive for mobile displays) and there are a couple of small bugs that could be ironed out - however, I feel that this small project has taught me a lot and now I am at the stage of diminishing returns. Therefore, I would prefer to instead focus myself on newer projects.
